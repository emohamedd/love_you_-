When you run the Love Code, it will display the following interactions:

1.  It will greet you with the message "What is Your name?" You can enter your name, allowing the program to personalize the experience.

2.  Next, the program will prompt you with the question "How Much Do You Love Me (1-10)?" Here, you can rate your love on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 representing the highest level of affection.

3.  Based on your response, the program generates a unique love message. If your rating is zero or less, it will display "Don't Need Your Love." However, if your rating is greater than zero, it will display "I Love You Very," followed by a beautiful visual representation of your love.

4.  The program will then create a delightful loop, where the word "Very" is repeated, creating an enchanting rhythm that resonates with the intensity of your love.

5.  As the loop progresses, the word "Very" is gradually displayed with decreasing indentation, symbolizing the ebb and flow of love.

6.  Finally, the program concludes with the message "Much {name}," where `{name}` is the name you provided at the beginning. This final message encapsulates the depth of your affection.

The Love Code aims to create a romantic and memorable experience for you and your loved one, allowing you to express your love with a touch of technology and creativity. Enjoy the beauty of love expressed through the language of code!
